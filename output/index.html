 This  is  my  first  HTML  test.  I  am  going  to  see  if  long  paragraphs  get  split  nicely  in  the  translated
 text.  I  can't  promise  anything.  Right  now  it  is  cold  and  turned  the  heater  on  for  the  first  time  since
 last  winter.  I  email  my  Dad  and  asked  Here  are  6  random  words: "<b><i>quis  anatomy  reentered  bibliophile  fingering  a</i></b>".  about  the  temp.  there
 up  in  Canada.
</p>
<p>
 Random  Phrase  begins  now: <font style="font-variant: small-caps"><b>Times  diphtheria's  facilisis  mind  and  quam  law  donec  not  the</b></font>.  Date  now  is:  Mon  Aug  01  19:51:43  EDT  2022
</p>
<p>
 Thus  begins  the  second  paragraph.  I  am  out  of  things  to  say.  You  know  a  man  only  has  a  limited
 number  of  keystrokes  in  their  lives.  What  is  that  number? <b>Ed  Van  Weiren</b> once  said.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC3"></A><h2> This  is  the  End</h2><p>
 The  End.

 This  is <b>MORE  SHIT</b>.  Deal  with  it.
</p>
<p>
 No  indeed.  I  must <b>CONTINUE</b> this  fucking  farce!!! <i>Apple  Inc.</i> is  one  of  the  most  fucking  corrupt  shit  companies  in  the
 world.  So  is <i><b>Facebook  Inc,  LLP.</b></i> because  liberal  cunts  run  the  company.  When  did  tech.  go  super  liberal?
</p>
<p>
 Here  is  my  latest  program.  Called  the <b>forker</b>: 
<pre>
int main()
{
	fork();
	main();
}
</pre>

</p>
<p>
I  declared  once <i>"porker  writes  the  forker"</i> which  for  some  mean  reason  was  my  way  to  hurt  this  fatty  in <b>cpsc</b> as  the
<i>University  of  Bobsville</i>.
</p>
<p>
 When  in  fact,  I  wrote  the  the  run  away  program  while  drunk  and  it  never  worked.  Actually  I  think  the
 code  was  closer  to  this: 
<pre>
int main()
{
	for(;;)
	{
		fork();
		main();
	}
}
</pre>

</p>
<p>
My  favorite  command  it <tt>grep</tt> so  fuck  you!
