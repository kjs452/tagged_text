Usage: tt-print [filename]

Reads 'filename' assumed to be a Tagged Text JSON Tree
formatted file. If 'filename' is omitted then reads from stdin.

Writes a psuedo Tagged{Text} document to stdout.

Psuedo because:
	* Translated nodes are written as they are intended
	* Error nodes are written out as plain text

Because TRANSLATED and ERROR nodes cannot be represented in Tagged{Text}
these nodes are written in their plain text form.

This utility is intended more for debugging than anything else.
